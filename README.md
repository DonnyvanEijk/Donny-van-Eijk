The developer Donny has been around coding since his young ages 
he always liked to build stuff and play games on the playstation 3 or wii butr was but was always curious
HOW THEY WHERE BUILD

## My  Beginning

Now my beginning is very easy. i just looked up on google: "How to make game without app" so i ended up using scratch for a year,\
eventually i made a lot of other cool games as platformers and clickers with a lot of difficulty those days. Some years later i was like: "I WANNA MAKE A WEBSITE" 
so ye i just searched up "how to make website" and i ended up with visual studio code and HTML my saviors.
So i got my own host form my dad "dvegamning.com" and i started trying stuff out. At first it was pretty easy but then i tried using css and thats where i got stuck.
NOW THE BEST CHAPTER OF MY LIFE COMES IN

Techniekcollege showed me all the tips to fast learning code of the web css and even javascript. i have mode so many funny and cool projects since then form destrpying city's with explosion sounds to making a 
full on pokemon remake for a GameJam and the journey so far is just straigt up amazing. 

Back to the future aka now we finnaly have my beautifull intership where i learn so much everyday and even now i am still learning how to make cool things with three.js next.js and larravel php

### My first big personal project

As my first big personal goal i wanted to attend to a GameJam and at the time i was a javascript only developer. So i was looking for GameJams with javascript and i found GameDev.js as my first ever gamejam. I started with the
project with my classmates Marc and Lawaz. We made a game about time-travelling advwenture and humor . and lets just say we weren't last place, and thats amazing for me that means that i straight up outmastered some developers in my skills
this gamejam also tought me that deadlines are a imoportant thing to look at and that its importatnt to have something done.
